## Authentication

You will first need to create an application on the Azure AD Admin Portal. Follow the steps outlined
below to do this:

-   Navigate to <https://portal.azure.com> in a browser and log in with a Microsoft account

-   Select **Azure Active Directory** from the left side menu

-   From the left panel, select **App Registrations**

-   At the top of the middle section, select **New registration**

-   On the next page, give your application a name and click **Register**

-   Once the app is created, the below steps need to be taken on the next page:

      

    -   Under **Certificates & secrets** select **New client secret** . Note down this key somewhere
        secure, as it cannot be retrieved after closing the window.

    -   Under **Authentication** , select **Add a platform** . In the **Add a platform** window,
        select **Web** . The **Redirect URLs** should be filled right here. We will get **Redirect
        URLs** from the Phantom asset we create below in the section titled **Phantom Asset for
        SharePoint** . This step is required only if you are a non-admin user.

    -   Under **API Permissions** Click on **Add a permission** .

    -   Under the **Microsoft API** section, select **Microsoft Graph** .

    -   There are two ways to gives the Application and Delegated permissions to the app.

          

        1.  Permissive mode
            -   Sites.Read.All
            -   Files.Read.All
            -   Files.ReadWrite.All
            -   Sites.ReadWrite.All
        2.  Restrictive mode
            -   Sites.Selected (only Application permission)

            The user will have to configure permissions for each of the sites that they are working
            with. You can find more information
            [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/controlling-app-access-on-specific-sharepoint-site-collections/)
            . Also, while using this mode 'list sites' action will return the empty list.  
            **Note:** You need **Sites.FullControl.All** Application permission while using the site
            permission endpoint.

    -   After making these changes, click **Add permissions** at the bottom of the screen.

-   If you are an admin user, then click **Grant admin consent for Phantom** and provide admin
    consent. And configure asset configuration parameter **Admin Consent Already Provided** with
    value **True** .

-   If you are a non-admin user, then follow the steps listed below to grant admin consent:

      

    -   Configure an asset configuration parameter **Admin Consent Already Provided** with value
        **False** .
    -   You must have configured the **Redirect URLs** mentioned in the above steps.To configure
        **Redirect URLs** , checkout the section titled **Phantom Asset for SharePoint** below.
    -   Run the **Test Connectivity** .
    -   You will be asked to open a link in a new tab. Open the link in the same browser so that you
        are logged into Splunk Phantom for the redirect. If you wish to use a different browser, log
        in to the Splunk Phantom first, and then open the provided link.
    -   Proceed to log in to the Microsoft site with the admin user.
    -   You will be prompted to agree to the permissions requested by the App.
    -   If all goes well the browser should instruct you to close the tab.
    -   Now go back and check the message on the Test Connectivity dialog box, it should say **Test
        Connectivity Passed** .

## Phantom Asset for SharePoint

When creating an asset for the **MS Graph for SharePoint** app, place the **Application ID** and
**Client secret** of the app created during the previous step in the **Client/Application ID** and
**Client Secret** fields respectively. You can also find **Tenant ID** on the application overview
page. After filling in all the required values, click **SAVE** .  
  
After saving, a new field will appear in the **Asset Settings** tab. Take the URL found in the
**POST incoming for MS Graph for SharePoint to this location** field and place it in the **Redirect
URLs** field mentioned in a previous step. After doing so the URL should look something like:  

https://\<phantom_host>/rest/handler/msgraphforsharepoint_7963f3ef-b527-40e5-a704-392c56f0a88d/\<asset_name>

  
Additionally, updating the Base URL in the Company Settings is also required. Navigate to
**Administration \> Company Settings \> Info** to configure the **Base URL For Splunk SOAR** . Then,
select **Save Changes** .  
  
For the asset configuration parameter **SharePoint Site ID** , it should be in the format
**{Hostname},{SPSite-id},{SPWeb-id}** . You can get the **SharePoint Site ID** by running the
**'list site'** action. For more information check out the [Microsoft
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/sharepoint?view=graph-rest-1.0#note-for-existing-sharepoint-developers)
.

## Restrictions and Limitations

Some special characters aren't allowed as a SharePoint **list name** and **file/folder name** . If
you have created the list/files with these special characters, SharePoint API will not allow us to
retrieve the list information. For more information about limitations check out the [Microsoft
documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/905231) .  
As a workaround for lists, we can use the list_id instead of the list_name. Run the 'list lists'
action to get the list_id.

## Port Information

The app uses HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the Microsoft servers. Below are the
default ports used by Splunk SOAR.

|         Service Name | Transport Protocol | Port |
|----------------------|--------------------|------|
|         http         | tcp                | 80   |
|         https        | tcp                | 443  |
