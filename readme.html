    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    You will first need to create an application on the Azure AD Admin Portal. Follow the steps outlined below to do this:
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">https://portal.azure.com</a> in a browser and log in with a Microsoft account</li>
      <li>Select <b>Azure Active Directory</b> from the left side menu</li>
      <li>From the left panel, select <b>App Registrations</b></li>
      <li>At the top of the middle section, select <b>New registration</b></li>
      <li>On the next page, give your application a name and click <b>Register</b></li>
      <li>Once the app is created, the below steps need to be taken on the next page:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Under <b>Certificates & secrets</b> select <b>New client secret</b>. Note down this key somewhere secure, as it cannot be retrieved after closing the window.</li>
          <li>Under <b>Authentication</b>, select <b>Add a platform</b>. In the <b>Add a platform</b> window, select <b>Web</b>. The <b>Redirect URLs</b> should be filled right here. We will get <b>Redirect URLs</b> from the Phantom asset we create below in the section titled <b>Phantom Asset for SharePoint</b>. This step is required only if you are a non-admin user.</li>
          <li>Under <b>API Permissions</b> Click on <b>Add a permission</b>.</li>
          <li>Under the <b>Microsoft API</b> section, select <b>Microsoft Graph</b>.</li>
          <li>Provide the following Application permissions to the app.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Sites.Read.All</li>
              <li>Files.Read.All</li>
              <li>Files.ReadWrite.All</li>
            </ul>
          <li>After making these changes, click <b>Add permissions</b> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>If you are an admin user, then click <b>Grant admin consent for Phantom</b> and provide admin consent. And configure asset configuration parameter <b>Admin Consent Already Provided</b> with value <b>True</b>.</li>
      <li>If you are a non-admin user, then follow the steps listed below to grant admin consent:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Configure an asset configuration parameter <b>Admin Consent Already Provided</b> with value <b>False</b>.</li>
          <li>You must have configured the <b>Redirect URLs</b> mentioned in the above steps.To configure <b>Redirect URLs</b>, checkout the section titled <b>Phantom Asset for SharePoint</b> below.</li>
          <li>Run the <b>Test Connectivity</b>.</li>
          <li>You will be asked to open a link in a new tab. Open the link in the same browser so that you are logged into Splunk Phantom for the redirect. If you wish to use a different browser, log in to the Splunk Phantom first, and then open the provided link.</li>
          <li>Proceed to log in to the Microsoft site with the admin user.</li>
          <li>You will be prompted to agree to the permissions requested by the App.</li>
          <li>If all goes well the browser should instruct you to close the tab.</li>
          <li>Now go back and check the message on the Test Connectivity dialog box, it should say <b>Test Connectivity Passed</b>.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phantom Asset for SharePoint</h2>
    When creating an asset for the <b>MS Graph for SharePoint</b> app, place the <b>Application ID</b> and <b>Client secret</b> of the app created during the previous step in the <b>Client/Application ID</b> and <b>Client Secret</b> fields respectively. You can also find <b>Tenant ID</b> on the application overview page. After filling in all the required values, click <b>SAVE</b>.
    <br><br>
    After saving, a new field will appear in the <b>Asset Settings</b> tab. Take the URL found in the <b>POST incoming for MS Graph for SharePoint to this location</b> field and place it in the <b>Redirect URLs</b> field mentioned in a previous step. After doing so the URL should look something like:
    <pre>
    https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/msgraphforsharepoint_7963f3ef-b527-40e5-a704-392c56f0a88d/&lt;asset_name&gt;
    </pre>
    <br>
    Additionally, updating the Base URL in the Company Settings is also required. Navigate to <b>Administration > Company Settings > Info</b> to configure the <b>Base URL For Splunk SOAR</b>. Then, select <b>Save Changes</b>.
    <br><br>
    For the asset configuration parameter <b>SharePoint Site ID</b>, it should be in the format <b>{Hostname},{SPSite-id},{SPWeb-id}</b>. You can get the <b>SharePoint Site ID</b> by running the <b>'list site'</b> action. For more information check out the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/sharepoint?view=graph-rest-1.0#note-for-existing-sharepoint-developers" target="_blank">Microsoft documentation</a>.

  <h2>Restrictions and Limitations</h2>
  Some special characters aren't allowed as a SharePoint list name. If you have created the list with these special characters, SharePoint API will not allow you to retrieve the list information. For more information check out the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/905231" target="_blank">Microsoft documentation for limitations</a>.
  <br><br>
  As a workaround, you can use the list_id instead of the list_name. Follow the below steps to find the list_id from SharePoint UI.
  <ul>
    <li>Open SharePoint, and navigate to the list that contains your workflow.</li>
    <li>Click on the <b>Settings</b> icon and then select <b>List Settings</b>.</li>
    <li>Copy the URL, and find the text after <b>List=</b>.</li>
    <li>Remove "%7B" from the front of the list and "%7D" from the end of the list.</li>
    <li>Replace %2D with a hyphen(-) if applicable.</li>
    For example:
    <br> 1. "%7B9D5F2138%2DC9E6%2D4473%2DA094%2DD7F4284C0388%7D" to "9D5F2138-C9E6-4473-A094-D7F4284C0388"
    <br> 2. "%7B72c91cad-fd79-4604-877b-1e34552f0297%7D" to "72c91cad-fd79-4604-877b-1e34552f0297"
  </ul>
